chapter 17 IAM

roles
- primitive
- predefined
- custom

service accounts (sa)
- used to provide identities independent of human users
- sa are identities that can be granted roles 
- working with scopes
- assigning service accounts to VMs

managing sa with scopes
- Scopes are permissions granted to a VM to perform some operation
- Scopes authorize the access to API methods
- The service account assigned to a VM has roles associated with it
- To configure access controls for a VM, you will need to configure both IAM roles and scopes

A scope is specified using a URL that starts with https://www.googleapis.com/auth/ and is then followed by permission on a resource.

For example, the scope allowing a VM to insert data into BigQuery is as follows: 
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/bigquery.insertdata

The scope that allows viewing data in Cloud Storage is as follows:
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only

And to write to Compute Engine logs, use this:
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/logging.write

- An instance can only perform operations allowed by both IAM roles assigned to the service account and scopes defined on the instance
- For example, if a role grants only read- only access to Cloud Storage but a scope allows write access, then the instance will not be able to write to Cloud Storage

An example scope assignment using gcloud is as follows:
gcloud compute instances set-service-account ace-instance \ --service-account examadmin@ace-exam-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com \ --scopes compute-rw,storage-ro

-- service account for VM instance
gcloud compute instances create [INSTANCE_NAME] --service-account [SERVICE_ ACCOUNT_EMAIL]
