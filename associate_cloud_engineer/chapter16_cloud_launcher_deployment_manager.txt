chapter 16 - deploying applications with cloud launcher and deployment manager 

cloud launcher = marketplace

** deploying a solution using cloud launcher
- cloud launcher is a central repository of applications and datasets that can be deployed into GCP env
- 2 step process
	- browsing for a solution that fits your needs
	- deploying that solution
- browsing 
	- search by category
	- datasets etc
	- operating systems etc

- e.g wordpress
	- launch on compute engine
	- provide deployment name, zone , boot disk , external IP etc
	- click deployment manager to see the progress of installation
	- launch wordpress based on username password information

** deploying a solution using deployment manager
- create your own solution configuration so users can launch preconfigured solutions

- deployment manager (DM) config files are written in YAML
- resources
	- resource entities : name, type, properties

E.g yaml file 

resources:
- type: compute.v1.instance
	name: ace-exam-deployment-vm 
	properties:
		machineType: [MACHINE_TYPE_URL]
		disks: [KEY]:[VALUE] [KEY]:[VALUE]

template files
- if deployment configurations are becoming complicated, you can use deployment templates
- templates are another text file you use to define resources and import those resources into configuration files
- allows you to reuse res definitions in multiple places
- templates can be written in Python or Jinja 2

Launch a deployment template using command 
- gcloud deployment-manager deployments create
- e.g gcloud deployment-manager deployments create quickstart-deployment --config vm.yaml
