Cloud SDK
- set of tools that you can use to manage resources and apps hosted on GCP
- includes gcloud, gsutil, bq 
- gcloud is downloaded along with cloud sdk


***sdk components***
- installable parts of SDK
- a component can be command line tool (gcloud, bq and gsutil)
- a component can be a set of gcloud CLI commands at alpha or beta release levels
- a component can be a package that contains dependencies used by a tool in the SDK

default components
- when you install the SDK, below components are installed by default
	- gcloud : tool for interacting with GCP
	- bq : tool for working with data in google bigquery
	- gsutil : tool for performing tasks related to google cloud storage
	- core : libraries used internally by sdk tools

alpha & beta components
- not installed by default
	- alpha : gcloud CLI commands at the Alpha release level.
	- beta : gcloud CLI commands at the Beta release level.

Managing cloud SDK components
- list, install, update and remove Google Cloud SDK components to suit your needs

list components using - gcloud components list
install components using - gcloud components install [COMPONENT-ID]
gcloud components update - will update all components to latest version
remove components using - gcloud components remove [COMPONENT-ID]


***sdk properties***
what are sdk properties?
- Properties are settings that govern the behavior of the gcloud CLI and other SDK tools
- Properties can be used to define a per-product or per-service setting
- e.g setting default region while using compute engine

properties and flags
- Properties allow you to maintain the same settings across command executions
- Flags affect command behavior on a per-invocation basis
- Note that flags override properties when both are set


***configurations***
- a named set of SDK properties
- e.g gcloud cli uses a configuration named "default" as initial active configuration


listing properties
- gcloud config list
- sample output

[compute]
region = us-east1
zone = us-east1-d
[core]
account = user@google.com
disable_usage_reporting = False
project = example-project
[metrics]
command_name = gcloud.config.list

To set a property in the active configuration, run gcloud config set 
- gcloud config set project [PROJECT]

- you can also set properties via environment variables

unset properties using - gcloud config unset disable_usage_reporting
