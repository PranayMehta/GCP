-- Chapter 11 - planning storage in cloud

-- choose best storage solution

storage solutions vary by 
1.time to access data
2.data model
3.other features - consistency, availability and support for transactions

Types of storage systems
- latency is measures in nano, mirco and milli seconds

GCP storage services
- redis cache service for caching
- persistent disk storage for VMs
- object storage
- archival storage for long term, infrequent access requirements

Cache
- in-memory data store
- low latency
- faster response time
- limited in mem size
- if machine hosting the cache is shut down, content is lost

memory store(MS)
- MemoryStore, a managed Redis service
- redis is a widely used open source cache
- MS is protocol compatible with redis
- Application developers can use caches to store data that is retrieved from a database and then retrieved from the cache instead of the disk the next time that data is needed
- When you use Memorystore, you create instances that run Redis. The instance is con- figured with 1GB to 300GB of memory
- configuring a MS
	- choose memory options for redis instance
	- location
	- basic tier - no replica, costs less
	- standard tier - failover replica in separate zone for high availability
	- IP range

Persistent disk storage(PD)
- PD provides block storages
- users can create file systems
- can be attached to compute engine VMs or GKE VMs
- not directly attached to physical servers hosting ur VMs
- VMs can have locally attached SSDs but data is lost when VM is terminated
- data on PD continues to exist even after VM is shut down n terminated
- PD exists independently of VMs, local attached SSDs do not
Features of PDs
- can be HDD or SSD
- SSD high thruput
- HDD low cost, batch data operations
- max SSD n HDD storage is 64TB
- auto encrypt data on disk
- how do u want ur disks? zonal or regional?
	- zonal stores data across physical drives in multiple zones
	- regional replicates data blocks across 2 zones within a region, but is costly

Object Storage
- large volumes of data (exabytes), and share it widely then use object storage
- GCP's object storage is cloud storage (GCS)
Features
- files r stored in the system as atomic units
- u cant operate on a part of the file
- u can perform operations on object, deleting an object etc
- does not support concurrency and locking  - last data written to file is stored
- a bucket is the logical unit of organization in gcs
- object storage does not provide a file system
- bucket name has to be globally unique
4 diff class of storage
1. regional
- Regional buckets are redundant across zones 
2. multi-regional
- Data is replicated in multiple regions
- Multiregional buckets are used when content needs to be stored in multiple regions to ensure acceptable times to access content
- Provides redundancy in case of zone-level failures
Both 1&2 are used for frequently used data
- If users are glob- ally dispersed and require access to synchronized data, then multi-regional may provide better performance and availability
3. nearline
- cases in which you expect to access files less than once per month
4. coldline
- Coldline storage is designed, and priced, for files expected to be accessed once per year or less
Both 3&4 have retrieval costs

Versioning and object lifecycle management
- conditions and actions
- rules apply to all objects in a bucket
- nearline can go to coldline, reverse not true
